# Bug Fix Summary - October 2025

## Critical Bug: Inflated Non-localized Polymerase Readings

### Problem Identified
- **Symptom**: Non-localized polymerase showing 80-90% of total signal
- **Expected**: 5-10% for human genome samples
- **Impact**: All functional region percentages were incorrect, making biological interpretation impossible

### Root Cause
Sequential masking in `bin/functional_regions.py` was completely disabled. The code:
1. Started with full signal in "residual" bedGraphs
2. Mapped signal to each functional region
3. **Never subtracted assigned regions** from residuals (lines 350-353, 391-392 commented out)
4. Calculated "Non-localized" as residuals = still contained 100% of original signal

**Result**: The "Non-localized polymerase" category incorrectly contained the entire genome's signal instead of only truly unassigned regions.

---

## Changes Made

### 1. **Fixed Functional Regions Assignment** (`bin/functional_regions.py`)

**Lines Changed**: 340-395

**What was broken:**
```python
# NOTE: Disabled masking to prevent over-aggressive signal removal
# bg_subtract(str(pos_res), region_plus, str(pos_res))  # COMMENTED OUT
# bg_subtract(str(neg_res), region_minus, str(neg_res))  # COMMENTED OUT
```

**Fix applied:**
```python
# Sequential masking: subtract assigned signal from residuals
# This ensures each signal is counted in exactly ONE functional category
bg_subtract(str(pos_res), region_plus, str(pos_res))
bg_subtract(str(neg_res), region_minus, str(neg_res))
```

**Impact**: 
- ✅ Each signal now assigned to exactly ONE functional category
- ✅ Hierarchical assignment: Promoter → Gene Body → CPS → Short Genes → Enhancers → TW → Non-localized
- ✅ Non-localized should drop from ~80% to ~5-10%

---

### 2. **Implemented QC Module** (`modules/13_qc_pol2_tracktx.nf`)

**Status**: Was a stub outputting dummy data

**Before:**
```bash
echo '{"status": "minimal_test"}' > qc_pol2.json
```

**After**: Full implementation with:
- ✅ Strand bias calculation (+ vs - strand reads)
- ✅ Fragment length distribution (PE only)
- ✅ Mean coverage depth
- ✅ **Deduplicated read counts** (critical for unlocalized_fraction calculation)
- ✅ MAPQ filtering statistics
- ✅ Comprehensive QC JSON with all metrics

**Impact**: 
- Enables alternative unlocalized calculation: `1 - (functional_reads / dedup_reads)`
- Provides proper QC metrics for sample quality assessment
- Reports will show accurate duplication rates, mapping rates, etc.

---

### 3. **Fixed Parameter Inconsistencies** (`params.yaml`)

**Problem**: Parameters in `params.yaml` didn't match what `functional_regions.py` actually uses

**Before:**
```yaml
functional_regions:
  prom_up: 250
  prom_down: 250
  gb_start_offset: 2000    # NOT USED
  cps_offset: 50           # NOT USED  
  tw_length: 5000          # WRONG (actual default: 10000)
  merge_gap: 50            # NOT USED
```

**After:**
```yaml
functional_regions:
  prom_up: 250           # Promoter upstream extent (bp from TSS)
  prom_down: 250         # Promoter downstream extent (bp from TSS)
  div_inner: 250         # Divergent inner boundary (bp upstream of TSS)
  div_outer: 750         # Divergent outer boundary (bp upstream of TSS)
  tw_length: 10000       # Termination window length (bp after CPS)
  min_signal: 0.0        # Minimum signal threshold
  count_mode: "signal"   # "signal" (default) or "event"
  allow_unstranded: true # Allow unstranded features
```

**Impact**: 
- ✅ Parameters now match actual implementation
- ✅ Correct defaults documented
- ✅ Clear descriptions for each parameter

---

### 4. **Updated Documentation**

**Created**: `docs/FUNCTIONAL_REGIONS.md`

Comprehensive documentation including:
- ✅ Biological hierarchy of region assignment
- ✅ Expected percentages for each category
- ✅ Quality control guidelines
- ✅ Troubleshooting guide for high non-localized readings
- ✅ Parameter explanations
- ✅ Algorithm details

**Updated**: `modules/10_call_functional_regions.nf`
- ✅ Module header now accurately describes sequential masking behavior

## How to Re-run Pipeline

### Option 1: Quick (Re-run affected steps only)
```bash
# Delete only the affected results
rm -rf results/07_functional_regions results/10_qc results/11_reports results/14_combined_report

# Resume pipeline (cached steps preserved)
nextflow run main.nf -profile docker -resume
```

### Option 2: Clean (Full re-run for verification)
```bash
# Clean everything
rm -rf results/ work/

# Fresh run
nextflow run main.nf -profile docker
```

### What Will Re-execute:
1. ✅ **Functional regions** - with proper masking
2. ✅ **QC module** - real metrics instead of dummy data
3. ✅ **Individual sample reports** - corrected percentages
4. ✅ **Combined report** - accurate cross-sample comparisons

### What Stays Cached:
- ⚡ Alignment (BAM files)
- ⚡ Track generation (bedGraphs, BigWigs)
- ⚡ Divergent transcription detection
- ⚡ Normalization
- ⚡ Pol II metrics (pausing index, density)

**Estimated time**: ~10-20% of original pipeline runtime

## Technical Details

### Why Was Masking Disabled?

The comment in the code said:
> "Disabled masking to prevent over-aggressive signal removal"

**Analysis**: This was likely added during debugging when someone thought signal was being "lost". However, this fundamentally broke the biological interpretation:

**Correct behavior**: Each signal belongs to ONE functional category
- A read at a promoter → counted as "Promoter" 
- That same signal should NOT also be counted as "Non-localized"
- Sequential masking ensures this exclusivity

**Broken behavior** (with masking disabled): Same signal counted multiple ways
- Counted in functional category → ✅ Correct
- Still present in residuals → ❌ Wrong
- Residuals reported as "Non-localized" → ❌ Inflated

### Two Methods for Calculating Unlocalized Fraction

**Method 1** (in `render_sample_report.py`):
```python
unlocalized_fraction = 1 - (reads_total_functional / dedup_reads)
```
- Uses total deduplicated reads as denominator
- Was returning `null` because QC module was a stub
- Now implemented with working QC module

**Method 2** (in `combine_reports.py`):
```python
unlocalized_fraction = non_localized_signal / total_functional_signal  
```
- Uses signal in "Non-localized polymerase" category
- Was showing ~80-90% because of the masking bug
- Now fixed with proper sequential masking

Both methods should give similar results (~5-10%) after fixes.

## Biological Rationale

### Why Sequential Masking Is Correct

In nascent RNA-seq (PRO-seq, GRO-seq, ChIP-seq):
1. Each sequenced fragment represents ONE Pol II molecule at ONE genomic location
2. That location should be classified into ONE functional category
3. Double-counting breaks biological interpretation

**Example**: A read at position chr1:1000
- If position is in a promoter → count as "Promoter"
- Don't also count it as "Non-localized"
- This is like accounting: each transaction in one category only

**Hierarchy exists because regions can overlap**:
- Promoters may extend into gene bodies
- Short genes may overlap termination windows
- Priority ensures consistent, reproducible classification

### Expected Distribution Biology

**Gene Body dominates (50-70%)**:
- Most Pol II molecules are elongating through gene bodies
- PRO-seq captures elongating polymerase across kilobases of transcript

**Promoter significant (10-20%)**:
- Paused Pol II at promoters is a key regulatory mechanism
- PRO-seq enriches for promoter-proximal signal

**Non-localized minimal (5-10%)**:
- Background transcription, unannotated genes
- Technical noise
- Intergenic regions

**High non-localized (>20%) indicates problems**:
- Wrong genome assembly
- Poor annotation
- Contamination or degraded sample

---

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Re-run pipeline to get corrected results
2. **Validation**: Compare with published PRO-seq datasets (should match expected distributions)
3. **Future**: Consider adding automated QC warnings when non-localized >20%

## Questions?

If you see unexpected results after re-running:
1. Check `docs/FUNCTIONAL_REGIONS.md` troubleshooting section
2. Verify genome assembly matches data
3. Review QC metrics in `results/10_qc/*/qc_pol2.json`
4. Check sample quality (duplication rate, mapping rate)
